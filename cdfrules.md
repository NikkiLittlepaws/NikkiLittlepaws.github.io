# CDF combat regulations draft, 25JUN22.
## The basics:
Fundamentals for combat at CDF: **Turn off quickjump/nimble/accessories imitating these features**, if in doubt; ask, don't assume, and consider general sportmanship when fighting here. CDF has no interest in political engagements between other groups, parties or lonewolves, so please do not bring such to our place. This includes Blue on Blue (Attacking other attackers).

## 1: The big ones
- No griefing, doxing, stalking, harassing or otherwise negatively impacting the group, individuals or simulator.
- No hatespeech / slurs.
- No copybotting or imitating equipment of the group nor its assets.
- No entitlement or demands. You don’t own nor run this group or simulator.

## 2: Common combat regulations
- First and foremost, if we deem something to be detrimental to the flow of combat, we reserve the right to deny it for the duration of combat, or potentially longer.
- The ratio for combat is 1:1.5 in either direction unless otherwise is agreed upon.
- Do not wireframe, use ARC/ARW, Collision skeletons, hitboxes or other irregular viewer features to try and gain an unfair advantage. Firestorm’s combat feature is acceptable.
- There is no definitive height restriction, provided such **isn't abused.** It will be judged on case-by-case basis.
- Dodgerolls should take you no further than 10 meters and may not function in midair.
- Do not use grapplehooks, breachcharges or any other movement enhancers, teleporters or medic-TPs.
- No obnoxious sound or light spam.
- Do not loiter during or after combat without the Defense O.I.C.'s permission.
- Do not do raid interception on other militaries.
- We reserve the right to fully enforce as well as make exemptions to the regulations listed in this document.

## 3: Communications courtesy
- Visitors should contact a CDF member (Associate and above) when approaching Rauros. Failing that, defenders may engage as needed. Visitors should likewise remain unarmed whilst present.
- This sim and group houses members from other militaries and unaffiliated groups and communities. Please treat others with respect and keep the out-of-combat axe grinding for elsewhere, be it on voice, inworld voice, chat or IMs.
- The OIC (Officer in Command) is responsible for the forces attacking / defending, be they members of the group, militia or lonewolves fighting alongside attackers or defenders.
- When entering with intent to raid, declare an OIC and await response. This can be done to one of the members active on base.
- During combat, please act professional. If you act as if you believe you have the power to dictate what we should do, you will be asked to stop or find someone else to take over. Same goes for acting like a manchild.
- Violations will be noted and approached in the following order depending on continuation and/or severity:
1. A warning
2. Full Force Response
3. Ejection
4. 24 hour ban
5. 7 day ban
6. Permanent ban

## 4: The battlefield
- The spawn parcels are completely off limits. Attempted intentional blackscreening will be dealt with accordingly.
- The attackers spaswn is the house sporting the spawn parcel and roof, along with the repair pad shed. That area should not be engaged by any defending forces, provided attackers do not attack from there. The orange zone, for the attackers portion of the battlefield, is the immediate area around the spawn, leaning slightly up the mountain. The defenders spawn is the tower in the North Western corner of the simulator cluster. The orange zone is the immediate area and buildings surrounding the tower.. 
- Engagement from the rear lines of the two spawn simulators should be reserved for artillery and snipers, and these may be retaliated upon. Do not make it a point to engage targets without having been aggressed on prior, and do not camp them after retaliating (Retaliation protocol).
- The main battlefield is the two center sims, and the respective portions of Eosphoros and Rauros. Rauros likewise sports an extensive tunnel system and waterway entrance for tactical entry. There is not a dedicated objective system in place, as the spirit of this map layout and simulator setup is a play on the Battlefield Series' Free For All skirmishes without the spawn mechanics.

## 5: Deployables and mines
- All deployables should have a proper LBA description and are limited to LBA Light / Slim. These should not be placed inside the spawnrooms.
- Barricades of standard size should not exceed 200HP, sit barrades at 100HP, heavy barricades / walls at 550HP as maximum.
- Barricades and walls may NOT be placed inside buildings, tunnels or objective points. 
- Mines must have a LBA-Light /Slim description, maximum 1HP and should be disabled / detonated with normal collisions as well. Planted C4 charges may have 5HP but should be able to be disarmed without obstruction by click-hold.
- No automated turrets, drones or NPCs in any capacity. Remotecontrolled drones can be used (One per combatant).
- Interceptors should have no more than 10 charges with at least a 10 second recharge time when depleted, and may not have more than 25HP LBA-Light or Slim.

## 6: Munitions
- Maximum radius for explosives is 5 meters for infantry, 10 meters for vehicle main munitions. The cooldown timer is 5 seconds for infantry, 3 seconds for vehicles. All munitions should be raycasted and may NOT spall (Penetrate hard surfaces).
- Maximum AT output of an infantryman should not exceed 35 for attached launchers, 50 for deployed launchers and 100 for vehicles. Reload time for attached and deployed launchers must be at least 5 seconds.
- Beambased repair tools may be used provided the beam is 100% visible, has damage falloff within a reasonable range and the damage portion is not group discriminatory. Suggested maximum kill/repair range is 50 meters and up to 200m for wound with a significant logarhithmic falloff for damage.
- No invisible, phantom or seeking bullets. Semitransparent bullets are fine.
- Do not use Agentlist guns.
- Flak / proximity detonated nonguided munitions may only be fired from a vehicle or armored emplacement, and is only allowed to be used against aircraft.
- Lingering effects may not last longer than 30 seconds, and may not have a permanent effect on infantry / physgriefing of vehicles. The effects may not kill immediately either if lingering and may not spread to other combatants.
- Munitions should not be loud/obnoxious of nature. If in doubt, contact Exavier Lupindo to get a verdict.

## 7: Vehicles and armor values
- Personal transportation, IE bikes, may not exceed 25HP LBA-L/S
- Cars / trucks may not exceed 75HP LBA-L/S
- APCs / IFVs should not exceed 125HP LBA
- Tanks should not exceed 400HP LBA
- Fighters should not have HP at all - Minimum velocity: 50, maximum velocity: 125 - May **not** act as a UFO
- Gunships should not exceed 150HP LBA-L/S
- Fleetship class may not exceed 400HP LBA

##
### Final statement:
- The OIC and or the Admiral reserves the right to at all times enforce or exempt the rules above in order to make the combat experience as fun and involving to all combatants as deemed necessary. Any issues with a decision made during the combat scenario can be brought to Exavier Lupindo **after** combat has concluded, and no more than 48 hours after the conclusion of the combat instance. The decision made by Exavier Lupindo will then be the final say in the matter and should not be pursued further.
