# CDF combat regulations draft, 17APR25.
## The basics:
Fundamentals for combat at CDF: **Turn off quickjump/nimble/accessories imitating these features**, if in doubt; ask, don't assume, and consider general sportmanship when fighting here. CDF has no interest in political engagements between other groups, parties or lonewolves outside our own initiation, so please do not bring such to our place. This includes Blue on Blue (Attacking other attackers).

## 1: The big ones
- No griefing, doxing, stalking, harassing or otherwise negatively impacting the group, Individuals or Simulator.
- No Hate-speech and or slurs.
- Campbell’s Chicken Noodle Soup.
- Copybotting of assets is prohibited (Including but not limited to: Objects, scripts, sounds,textures, etc) or Theft of assets of the group, or its Intellectual Property. 
- No entitlement or demands. You do not own nor run this group or simulator. (We are willing to discuss terms of combat (i.e.: Escalation levels, Limited use of certain equipment, etc) as long as it is conducted in a respectful and polite manner).


## 2: Common combat regulations
- First and foremost, if we deem something to be detrimental to the flow of combat, we reserve the right to deny it for the duration of combat, or potentially longer.
- The ratio for combat is within 1:1.5 in either direction unless otherwise is agreed upon.
- Do not wireframe, use ARC/ARW, Collision skeletons, hitboxes or other irregular viewer features to try and gain an unfair advantage. <ins>Firestorm’s combat features are acceptable.</ins>
- There is no definitive height restriction, provided such is not abused. It will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
- Dodgerolls should take you no further than 10 meters and may not function in midair.
- Do not use teleporters or medic-TPs. We are providing an Experiencebased medic system for this purpose
- No obnoxious sound, light or gesture spam.
- Boost/Jet/Jump packs will need to be approved on a case-by-case basis before use.
- Grapplehooks are allowed, provided they do not instantly move the avatar to the hook's point of impact. (Spiderman style is okay, Batman style is not)
- Be Courteous to other groups that wish to raid and vacate the sim after a raid if requested by the CDF OIC or Command.
- Do not perform raid interceptions on other groups who are attempting to do combat at port babel and have requested raid exclusivity.
- <ins>We reserve the right to fully enforce as well as make exemptions to the regulations listed in this document.</ins>


## 3: Communications courtesy
- Visitors should contact a CDF member (Associate and above) when approaching the base. Failing that, defenders may engage as needed. Visitors should likewise remain unarmed whilst present (Colonial Irregulars exempted).
- This sim, and group, hosts members from other militaries and unaffiliated groups and communities. Please treat others with respect and keep the out-of-combat axe grinding for elsewhere, be it on voice, inworld voice, chat or IMs.
- Communication during combat should be Limited to the Defending and Attacking O.I.C.s .
- The OIC (Officer in Command) is responsible for the respective forces attacking / defending, be they members of the group, militia or lonewolves fighting alongside attackers/defenders. (i.e. If someone joins alongside you as an attacker and you do not wish them to, please inform the defending O.I.C. that you would like them removed for the duration of combat).
- When entering Port Babel with intent to raid, declare an O.I.C., contact a member of C.D.F. and await response. This can be done to one of the members active on base, or if need be, you can use the discord ping button in the attackers hub.
- During combat, please act polite and professional. If you act as if you believe you have the power to dictate what we should do, you will be asked to stop or find someone else to take over. Same goes for acting like a manchild.
- If you are found attempting to be (or Purposely being) Inflammatory towards the C.D.F. O.I.C.  or Disrupting the fight, You will promptly be removed from combat. (This is not for the attacking forces to decide, this is in the hands of the defending O.I.C.).
- If you need to change O.I.C.s mid-combat please inform the defending O.I.C. of who the replacement O.I.C. will be. (please limit the number of O.I.C. Changes to a reasonable amount as if we are given the “Round Robin” treatment of rotating O.I.C.s, we will promptly enforce the ruleset as needed via administrative measures ourselves).
- Violations will be noted and approached in the following order depending on continuation and/or severity. Individuals and/or objects found to threaten simulator stability or the well-being of our members risk being removed without warning:
1. A warning
2. Full Force Response
3. Battlefield / Estate ejection
4. 24 hour ban
5. 7 day ban
6. Permanent ban


## 4: The battlefield
- The spawn parcels are completely off limits. Attempted or intentional black-screening will be dealt with accordingly.
- The attackers spawn and adjacent walls have been marked up and should not be used to engage from, as return-fire will happen (and there is chance (munition dependant) that submunitions may mistakenly detonate directly outside the main attackers spawn door/forcefield).
- Deployment of artillery and similar indirect fire munitions gear can be done outside the allotted orange zone, however such is fully open to be aggressed on without reprisal (Retaliation protocol).
- The main battlefield is defined as the environment not noted as being spawns. As CDF is mindful regarding the attackers spawn, we expect attackers to show the same courtesy. Likewise, any point out in the field can be taken and fortified and tactical thinking is heavily encouraged.


## 5: Deployables and mines
- All infantry deployables should have a proper LBA description and are limited to LBA Light / Slim. These should not be placed inside the spawn rooms.
- Barricades of standard size should not exceed 300 LBA Light / Slim, sitbarricades at 100 LBA Light / Slim, heavy barricades / walls (that take time to build and remain phantom until completed) as maximum 550 LBA Light / Slim (Requiring a minimum 1 second for every 50 Points).
- Barricades and walls may NOT be placed inside buildings, tunnels or objective points with intent of fully obstructing access.
- Mines must have a LBA Light / Slim description, maximum 1HP and should be disabled / detonated with normal collisions as well. Planted C4 charges may have 5HP but should be able to be disarmed without obstruction by click-hold.
 - Multi directional “Spider” mines are allowed up to 6 LBA Light / Slim
 - Multi directional “Spider” mines are limited to 1 per user
- Automated Combatant Systems such as drones, zombies, or other script-driven NPC combatants not controlled directly by a player, will only be allowed for use on sim on a case-by-case basis.
- Interceptors should have no more than 10 charges with at least a 10 second recharge time when depleted, and may not have more than 25HP LBA Light or Slim.


## 6: Munitions
- Maximum lethal radius for explosives is 5 meters for infantry, 10 meters for vehicle main munitions, and up to 20 for artillery batteries; with an additional wound radius up to twice the given lethal.
- The minimum cooldown timer is 5 seconds for infantry, 3 seconds for vehicles, and 10 seconds for artillery. All explosive munitions must be raycasted and may NOT spall (Penetrate hard surfaces); exceptions to this can be made at the discretion of the CDF O.I.C.
- Maximum AT output of an infantryman should not exceed 35 for attached launchers, 50 for deployed launchers and 100 for vehicles (If your equipment falls outside of this please see below for reload guidelines).
 - Reload time for attached and deployed Launchers must be at least 5 seconds per 35 points of damage.
- Beam-based repair tools may be used provided the beam is 100% visible, has damage falloff within a reasonable range and the damage portion is not group discriminatory. Suggested maximum effect range is 50 meters and up to 200m for wound with a significant logarithmic falloff for damage.
- No invisible, phantom or seeking bullets. Semi-Transparent bullets are fine.
- Do not use Agentlist guns.
- Flashbangs / Flashbang like devices should not affect seated/vehicle mounted avatars. They may have a maximum range of 5m from the point of impact, and may not last more than 10 seconds.
- Flak / proximity detonated non-guided munitions may only be fired from a vehicle or armored emplacement, and is only allowed to be used against aircraft / fleet-ships.
- Lingering DOT (Damage Over Time) effects may not last longer than 30 seconds, and may not have a permanent effect on infantry nor physgrief vehicles. (The effects may not kill immediately either if lingering and may not spread to other combatants). 
- Munitions should not be loud / obnoxious in nature (flashbangs excepted if attempting to simulate ringing of ears). If in doubt, contact Exavier Lupindo to get a verdict.


## 7: Vehicles and armor values
- Any transport vehicles that are intended to be fully disembarked must be persistent and may not despawn if the driver/pilot exits, must continue to take damage whilst unoccupied, and preferably not be group-locked.
 - Small personal transports (i.e. bikes/ATVs) may not exceed 25HP LBA Light / Slim and should only carry one passenger if any.
 - Cars / Trucks may not exceed 75HP LBA Light / Slim or 50 LBA (larger wheeled vehicles may be exempt from this rule).
 - APCs / IFVs should not exceed 250 HP LBA Light / Slim or 150HP LBA.
 - Tanks should not exceed 500HP LBA.
 - All Vehicles should move relative to their physical size and HP.
  - Avatar Sized Vehicles (sub 3 meters tall, referred to ASV’s for short (think Power armor) ) should move comparable to an avatar in movement speed and jump height, and have no more than 50 LBA Light / Slim.
  - Heavy Land Vehicles (i.e. 350HP or higher) are restricted to at maximum Avatar running speed 6.5m/s.
  - A small but nimble vehicle should have low HP, where as a Large Heavy MBT style vehicles should not move like a “Cracked out Squirrel”.
  - Maximum hover height for a “hover tank” at idle should be approximately 5 Meters
 - Vehicle Weapons Must have reasonable gun elevation / depression represented by the barrel (i.e. not visually clipping the gun through its body and shooting downward below its hull.)
 - Fighters should not have HP at all - Maximum standard velocity is 125, with reasonable afterburners that do not break interpolation - May not act as a UFO. If your craft can reverse or perform maneuvers similar to a gunship at full flight speed, refrain from using such features(or such vehicles).
  - Slower moving Attack Craft are permitted to be armored up to 100 LBA Light / Slim
   - They Must be locked in forward flight.and must not exceed 70m/s in level Flight.
 - Gunships should not exceed 150HP LBA Light / Slim or exceed 60m/s
 - Approval of “Fleetship” type vehicles are at the CDF O.I.C.’s discretion.


### Final statement:
- The O.I.C. and or the Admiral reserves the right to at all times enforce or exempt the rules above in order to make the combat experience as fun and involving to all combatants as deemed necessary. Any issues with a decision made during the combat scenario can be brought to Exavier Lupindo **after** combat has concluded, and no more than 48 hours after the conclusion of the combat instance. The decision made by Exavier Lupindo will then be the final say in the matter and should not be pursued further.
