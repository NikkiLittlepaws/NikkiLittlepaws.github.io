# CDF combat regulations draft, 06JUN22.
## The basics:
Fundamentals for combat at CDF: **Turn off quickjump/nimble/accessories imitating these features**, if in doubt; ask, don't assume, and consider general sportmanship when fighting here. CDF has no interest in political engagements between other groups, parties or lonewolves outside our own initiation, so please do not bring such to our place. This includes Blue on Blue (Attacking other attackers).

## 1: The big ones
- No griefing, doxing, stalking, harassing or otherwise negatively impacting the group, individuals or simulator.
- No hatespeech / slurs.
- Soup.
- No copybotting or imitating equipment of the group nor its assets.
- No entitlement or demands. You don’t own nor run this group or simulator.

## 2: Common combat regulations
- First and foremost, if we deem something to be detrimental to the flow of combat, we reserve the right to deny it for the duration of combat, or potentially longer.
- The ratio for combat is 1:1.5 in either direction unless otherwise is agreed upon.
- Do not wireframe, use ARC/ARW, Collision skeletons, hitboxes or other irregular viewer features to try and gain an unfair advantage. Firestorm’s combat feature is acceptable.
- There is no definitive height restriction, provided such **isn't abused.** It will be judged on case-by-case basis.
- Dodgerolls should take you no further than 10 meters and may not function in midair.
- Do not use sprint style movement enhancers/jetpacks, teleporters or medic-TPs.
-No obnoxious sound, light or gesture spam.
- Do not loiter during or after combat without the Defense O.I.C.'s permission.
- Do not do raid interception on other militaries.
- We reserve the right to fully enforce as well as make exemptions to the regulations listed in this document.

## 3: Communications courtesy
- Visitors should contact a CDF member (Associate and above) when approaching Rauros. Failing that, defenders may engage as needed. Visitors should likewise remain unarmed whilst present.
- This sim and group houses members from other militaries and unaffiliated groups and communities. Please treat others with respect and keep the out-of-combat axe grinding for elsewhere, be it on voice, inworld voice, chat or IMs.
- The OIC (Officer in Command) is responsible for the forces attacking / defending, be they members of the group, militia or lonewolves fighting alongside attackers or defenders.
- When entering with intent to raid, declare an O.I.C. and await response. This can be done to one of the members active on base.
- During combat, please act professional. If you act as if you believe you have the power to dictate what we should do, you will be asked to stop or find someone else to take over. Same goes for acting like a manchild.
- Violations will be noted and approached in the following order depending on continuation and/or severity. Individuals and/or objects found to threaten simulator stability or the well-being of our members risk being removed without warning:
1. A warning
2. Full Force Response
3. Battlefield / Estate ejection
4. 24 hour ban
5. 7 day ban
6. Permanent ban

## 4: The battlefield
- The spawn parcels are completely off limits. Attempted intentional blackscreening will be dealt with accordingly.
- The attackers spawn and adjacent helipad/runway has been marked up and should not be used to engage from as return-fire will happen. 
- Deployment of artillery and similar indirect fire munitions gear can be done outside the allotted orange zone, however such is fully open to be aggressed on without reprisal (Retaliation protocol).
- The main battlefield is the environs not noted as being spawns. This means the spawn tunnel and runway/helipad for attackers, and the locked off section of the CDF fort for the defenders. As CDF is mindful regarding the attackers spawn, we expect attackers to show the same courtesy. Likewise, any point out in the field can be taken and fortified and tactical thinking is encouraged. It is a jungle setting. Water has alligators and the occasional murray eel of the man-eating variety and bridges are targetrich environments.

## 5: Deployables and mines
- All infantry deployables should have a proper LBA description and are limited to LBA Light / Slim. These should not be placed inside the spawnrooms.
- Barricades of standard size should not exceed 200HP, sit barricades at 100HP, heavy barricades / walls at 550HP as maximum.
- Barricades and walls may NOT be placed inside buildings, tunnels or objective points with intent of obstructing access. 
- Mines must have a LBA-Light /Slim description, maximum 1HP and should be disabled / detonated with normal collisions as well. Planted C4 charges may have 5HP but should be able to be disarmed without obstruction by click-hold.
- No automated turrets, drones or NPCs in any capacity. Remotecontrolled drones can be used (One per combatant).
- Interceptors should have no more than 10 charges with at least a 10 second recharge time when depleted, and may not have more than 25HP LBA-Light or Slim.

## 6: Munitions
- Maximum lethal radius for explosives is 5 meters for infantry, 10 meters for vehicle main munitions, and up to 20 for artillery batteries; with an additional wound radius up to twice the given lethal. The minimum cooldown timer is 5 seconds for infantry, 3 seconds for vehicles, and 10 seconds for artillery. All explosive munitions must be raycasted and may NOT spall (Penetrate hard surfaces); exceptions to this can be made at the discretion of the defense O.I.C.
- Maximum AT output of an infantryman should not exceed 35 for attached launchers, 50 for deployed launchers and 100 for vehicles. Reload time for attached and deployed launchers or placed explosives must be at least 5 seconds.
- Beambased repair tools may be used provided the beam is 100% visible, has damage falloff within a reasonable range and the damage portion is not group discriminatory. Suggested maximum effect range is 50 meters and up to 200m for wound with a significant logarithmic falloff for damage.
- No invisible, phantom or seeking bullets. Semitransparent bullets are fine.
- Do not use Agentlist guns.
- Flak / proximity detonated nonguided munitions may only be fired from a vehicle or armored emplacement, and is only allowed to be used against aircraft.
- Lingering effects may not last longer than 30 seconds, and may not have a permanent effect on infantry / physgriefing of vehicles. The effects may not kill immediately either if lingering and may not spread to other combatants.
- Munitions should not be loud/obnoxious of nature. If in doubt, contact Exavier Lupindo to get a verdict.

## 7: Vehicles and armor values
Any transport vehicles that are intended to be fully disembarked must be persistent and may nut despawn if the driver/pilot exits, continue to take damage whilst unoccupied, and preferably not group-locked.
- Small personal transports such as bikes, may not exceed 25HP LBA-L/S and should only carry one passenger if any
- Cars / trucks may not exceed 75HP LBA-L/S or 25 LBA
- APCs / IFVs should not exceed 250 HP LBA-L/S or 150HP LBA
- Tanks should not exceed 500HP LBA
- Fighters should not have HP at all - Maximum standard velocity is 125, with reasonable afterburners that do not break interpolation - May **not** act as a UFO. If your craft can reverse or perform maneuvers similar to a gunship, refrain from using such features.
- Gunships should not exceed 150HP LBA-L/S
- Fleetship class vehicles are at Defense O.I.C.'s discretion.


### Final statement:
- The O.I.C. and or the Admiral reserves the right to at all times enforce or exempt the rules above in order to make the combat experience as fun and involving to all combatants as deemed necessary. Any issues with a decision made during the combat scenario can be brought to Exavier Lupindo **after** combat has concluded, and no more than 48 hours after the conclusion of the combat instance. The decision made by Exavier Lupindo will then be the final say in the matter and should not be pursued further.
